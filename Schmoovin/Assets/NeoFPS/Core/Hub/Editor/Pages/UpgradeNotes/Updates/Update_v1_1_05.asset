    h2Heading: 
    h3Heading: New Features
    bulletPoints:
    - New wieldable stance managers that can be used for weapon stances/poses
    - Procedural and keyframed sprint animation handlers for weapons
    - New BetterSpringRecoilHandler firearm module replaces the old spring recoil
      module and is much more intuitive and powerful
    - New breathing system provides a consistent way to count breaths for procedural
      animation (new BreathingEffect additive transform component), as well as firing
      unity events on breath for things like particle systems
    - StaminaSystem tracks the player character's stamina and can modify movement
      speed and breathing rate based on fatigue
    - CameraShake additive effect for use with continuous shakes such as earthquakes,
      and one-off shakes such as explosions
    - New step tracking system added to MotionController and motion graph
    - New PositionBob and RotationBob spring effects replace deprecated (but still
      functional) HeadBob and WeaponBob
    - LockInventorySelection and UnlockInventorySelection motion graph behaviours
      let you set the character inventory to a specific item, hands (backup item)
      or nothing when entering and exiting motion states
    - AdditiveJiggle adds a Z-axis rotation spring effect
    - Added quickstart to hub for firearm overheat
    - Set up Demo Facility with its own character, motion graph and weapons

    h2Heading: 
    h3Heading: Component Changes
    bulletPoints:
    - New restriction on AdvancedParticleSystemMuzzleEffect that the effect transform
      must be a child object (examples updated)
    - Demo firearms have been switched to the new BetterSpringRecoilHandler modules
    - WeaponBob and HeadBob have been deprecated and replaced with PositionBob and
      RotationBob (the old ones still work, but you should switch to the new ones)
    - Bob effects are now driven via the motion graph. To get PositionBob and RotationBob
      working, you must either add TrackSteps behaviours to the motion graph states
      or sub-graphs that you want bobbing on (best), or set the MotionController's
      "Use Dumb Stepping" property to true.
    - Fixes to the pivot point calculations in the AdditiveTransformHandling (better
      stacking) might make some procedural animations look different

    h2Heading: 
    h3Heading: Script Changes
    bulletPoints:
    - CharacterTriggerZone and CharacterTriggerZonePersistent have had their OnTrigger*
      methods renamed to OnCharacter* due to Unity throwing errors that messages must
      use a collider parameter
    - New events in IModularFirearm, IMeleeWeapon and IThrownWeapon interfaces
    - IThrownWeapon interface has new properties for throw durations
    - Some firearm modules now assume there is an IPoseManager component on the firearm
      (the ModularFirearm now implements this, but any custom firearm behaviours will
      not)
    - IWieldable and IQuickSlotItem interfaces now have DeselectInstant() methods
      that need implementing
    - IAdditiveTransform interface now has bool properties for bypassing position
      and rotation scaling
    - IAimer interface switched onAimUp and onAimDown events to single onAimStateChanged
      with transitions included
    - ITrigger interface gained an onStateChanged event
