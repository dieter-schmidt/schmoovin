    h3Heading: Component Changes
    bulletPoints:
    - All inventory items now use the new inventory database system instead of inventory
      keys. The inventory database can be found alongside the other managers. It also
      includes a "constants" database table which uses the FpsInventoryKey constants
      for fixed entries, meaning any items using the old setup will still work, but
      should be switched over when possible
    - NeoCharacterController forces have been fixed to be consistent with rigidbody
      forces
    - Modular firearm now exposes movement accuracy settings, and damping alters behaviour
      from previous
    - Stacked inventory wieldables are now fixed at the maximum stack size of 10 (other
      options were causing confusion)

    h2Heading: 
    h3Heading: Script Changes
    bulletPoints:
    - MotionController character height can no longer be set via property - must use
      methods.
    - Character trigger zone methods have been renamed to prevent being incorrectly
      called by physics messages
    - IHealthManager interface adds new damage methods with a RaycastHit parameter
    - IAimController interface has new steering and aimYawDiff properties
    - ITriggerModule interface requires new onShootContinuousChanged event and cancelOnReload
      property
    - Ballistic projectiles now use a common base class
    - Firearm modules now use a common base class. Custom versions may need editor
      scripts
    - IInventory interface has new AddItemFromPrefab method
    - IInteractiveObject interface now requires an onTooltipChanged event implementing
    - IProjectile interface adds new Teleport method
    - IMotionGraphDataOverride interface has been changed to allow stacking. Functions
      now take the previous override in the stack's output as a parameter.
