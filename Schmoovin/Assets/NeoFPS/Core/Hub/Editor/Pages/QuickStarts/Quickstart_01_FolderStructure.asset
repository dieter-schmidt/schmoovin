      spawning system. The spawning system uses a separate object for the player and
      the player character, allowing the player to switch between controlling multiple
      characters. The \"NeoFPS Solo Player\" is the player prefab that is used for
      all of the demo characters except for the spawnerless one.\r\n\r\nThe \"Prototype
      Spawnerless Character\" bypasses the spawning system and can be useful when
      testing or building prototypes. It has a player behaviour attached directly
      to the character, and if it dies then the current scene will be reloaded."
