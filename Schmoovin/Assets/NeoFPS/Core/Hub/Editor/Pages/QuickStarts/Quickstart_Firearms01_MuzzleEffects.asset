      effects, from briefly enabling an object to complex particle systems.

    text: The demo guns provided with NeoFPS use a simple muzzle flash object by default.
      This works well for a low-poly style, but not for more realistic or stylised
      projects. To demonstrate an alternative approach using Unity's built-in particle
      system, each weapon has an alternative "realistic" muzzle effect prefab which
      is pre-configured to just drop in and work.

    text: The muzzle effects on the demo weapons can be swapped out very easily. As
      an example, let's do that for the assault rifle. First up, you will need to
      open the assault rifle prefab.

    text: The parent of the muzzle flash object is the main body of the gun. We want
      to replace the muzzle flash object with the new realistic muzzle flash prefab,
      using the same parent. To do this, delete the existing muzzle flash object and
      drag and drop the replacement prefab under the "WeaponAssaultRifle" object.

    text: "You also need to remove the \"Basic Game Object Muzzle Effect\" component
      from the root object of the firearm. Firearm modules can be attached to any
      child of the firearm and swapped at runtime. In this case, the replacement muzzle
      flash prefab uses an \"Advanced Particle Muzzle Effect\" component, which will
      register itself with the firearm on start.\r\n\r\nGive it a try! That should
      be everything required to swap the muzzle effect on a demo gun. If you want
      to create your own muzzle effects then you can use the sample prefabs as an
      example of how to set yours up. You can also see the other muzzle effect options
      in the NeoFPS documentation."

    bulletPoints: []
    text: In some cases the demo guns also use the muzzle flash transform to represent
      the muzzle tip position for the shooter module. This does not apply to the assault
      rifle, but if you see an error appear in the shooter module after making the
      above changes, then you will need to add a new game object positioned at the
      gun's muzzle tip (Z axis pointing forwards from the barrel) and parented to
      the gun body. Drag this new object onto the "Muzzle Tip" property on the shooter
      module and the error will be fixed.
